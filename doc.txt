What is JWT and Why Should You Use JWT
-JWT
    -JWT is Authorization not Authentication ***
        -Authentication = username, password
        -Authorization = check is the same user request (that login already), and role that user (login already) can do
    -normally we use session ID for Authorization send it to cookies of the browser
        -JWT use JSON web token instead cookies to do Authorization
-How JWT generate token
    -component of token
        -check token with hash the signature path (encrypt header + encrypt payload + secret_key) -> hash value (digest) it's gonna be match 100% from token that come -> mean no one edit it
-Use case
    -login in one sever -> allow to access another server (that relate and permit the first server) and it's will be still safe (both of server know secret_key)
